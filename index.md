# Mélusine Caillard

## À propos

I am a French engineer and PhD student in natural language processing and technology foresight. After graduating from ESME Sudria, I began a CIFRE PhD jointly conducted at Sorbonne Université / Arts et Métiers and IKOS Consulting.
My work focuses on using AI and NLP to detect emerging technological trends, assess innovation maturity, and support strategic decision-making in sectors such as rail transport and energy. I combine machine learning, TRIZ design theory, and semantic analysis to build tools that map innovation landscapes and anticipate future developments.
